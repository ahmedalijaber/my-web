    <h1>Machine learning vs Deep learning</h1>
    <p>Machine learning and deep learning are two subsets of artificial intelligence which have garnered a lot of attention over the past two years. If you’re here looking to understand both the terms in the simplest way possible, there’s no better place to be.</p>
    <p>Before I start, I hope you would be familiar with a basic understanding of what both the terms deep learning and machine learning mean. If you don’t, here are a couple of simple definitions of deep learning and machine learning for dummies:</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>What's the differences between machine learning and deep learning?</strong>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/supervised-learning"><strong>Supervised</strong></a> machine Learning for dummies:</li>
        <p>A subset of artificial intelligence involved with the creation of algorithms which can modify itself without human intervention to produce desired output- by feeding itself through structured data.</p>
        <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-learning-and-data-clustering-eeecb78b422a"><strong>Unsupervised</strong></a> deep Learning for dummies:</li>
        <p>A subset of machine learning where algorithms are created and function similar to those in machine learning, but there are numerous layers of these algorithms- each providing a different interpretation to the data it feeds on. Such a network of algorithms are called artificial neural networks, being named so as their functioning is an inspiration, or you may say; an attempt at imitating the function of the human neural networks present in the brain.</p>
